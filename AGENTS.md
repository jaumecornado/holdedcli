# Repository Instructions

## Documentation language

All documentation must be written in English.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- architecture/design notes
- release notes and changelogs
- inline user-facing docs and guides

## Privacy and paths

Never use absolute local filesystem paths in repository content.

Use repository-relative paths only (for example, `.vscode/launch.json`, not
an absolute path).

Do not expose personal machine details, usernames, home directories, or other
sensitive local environment information in docs, examples, comments, commit
messages, or generated files.
